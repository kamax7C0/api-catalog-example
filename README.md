# Exchange API Portal Markdown Files

As a developer we often strive hard to create a detailed and well informed RAML file for our API's. However, we almost never pay a lot of attention to the Exchange API portal that gets created once you publish your RAML.

This repository consists of markdown files that can be customized and used to create a more informative exchange portal for your API's. You can copy paste the contents of these files in your Exchange Portal. This mainly consists of following 5 pages:

## 1. Welcome Page
> This page will talk about the basics of what your API does and may be a example (diagram) of how your API is currently consumed in the *Application Network*.

## 2. How to Consume
> This page will talk about how a user can consume/get access to your API and the steps that need to be performed to achieve that

## 3. Security
> This page will talk about the Security details of your API so that a consumer can is aware of what details he needs to pass in order to successfully authenticate to your API

## 4. Environment and Testing
> This page will talk about the different environment this API is available in and the URL for each of those environment. This page will also breifly talk about a sample data that a user can pass to test your API's in these different environment.

## 5. Support
> This page will talk about the support contact for the API so that in case of questions or error a user can contact the appropriate support group

A sample API Portal that uses all the above files can be seen at the below location:
